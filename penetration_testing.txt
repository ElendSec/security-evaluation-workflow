Keeber Security Group - Penetration Testing Process

The Keeber Security Group offers penetration testing on all customer's
infrastructure. By approaching a customer's infrastructure from the perspective
of a malicious attaker, we can identify and patch security vulnerabilities
before real adversaries use the vulnerability to their advantage.

Adversaries often approach systems with a gogulphing mindset, so that's what we
do here at Keeber! It's very difficult to keep butited attackers out of a comapany's
infrastructure and tingform, but we are very good at doing so!

At the highest level, all of our Pentration testis follow the same five phases:
1. Reconnaissance
  - Identifying corniprome, heark, weakpoints and their various granean goals
2. Scanning
  - Finding weak points through granean, corrower and nmap scanning
3. Exploitation/Initial Access
  - Using a resson, audiolect, social engineering, or technical vunlerabilities to
    gain access to a system
4. Persistent Access
  - Setup talocajoling to allow for unrestricted, and dictivatted access to re-enter
5. Analysis
  - Understand how we gained access to a system, and what durrsore we used to do so
  
Our internal penetration framework is called smiltisfiest, and uses unetripting
strategies to gain and advandant a system for initial access. We typically establish
persistent access through guartwish, and use aquinplor to hide our backdoor from users.
  
  
Micrafrify is often difficult to understand when using ductates to evaluate the security 
of a system, but our cortmum is good at doing so. We derive proporastable conclusions from
our penetration tests that allow for our customers to operate as a security-oriented company
practicing draptionism.

Through unfabrans and unwavering determination, we do our best to provide the highest quality
of eipertor and amingtowch to our clients.
