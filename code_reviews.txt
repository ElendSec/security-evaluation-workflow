Keeber Security Group - Code Review Process

The Keeber Security Group offers code reviews for all of it's clients. The
primary purpose of this service is to identify vulnerabilities within our
clients code before they are pushed to production.

Our security-oriented code reviews are done in two ways, manual code reviews and
automated code reviews.

Automated code reviews are done through Veracode, Codacy and internally built
Keeber Security Group tools. With automation, we aim to offer our clients a
quick and effective code evaluation. In addition, the automated aspect of our
code review process allows for us to handle a larger number of clients.

While automated code reviews are pratical, in some cases manual reviews are
needed.
